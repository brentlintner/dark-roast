dark-roast
==========

Compile CoffeeScript from non-standard file extensions.

### Usage

    npm install -g dark-roast

    dark-roast --help

### Examples

The CLI supports the `coffee` CLI, except for that it has the `--blend` option as well.

    dark-roast --blend .co lib -- --compile

### Warning!

This simple project came via an _experimental_ desire to choose aesthetics over standards.

This, however, is arguably a dark thing to do. Possibly an EVIL thing to do, and
something that could cause very serious repercussions, including:

* An open source community that hates you.
* Random bricks thrown through your window by said community.
* Being called a hipster because you name your script extension `allong√©`.
* The fact that unique, standard, globally recognizable file extensions keeps hell from spilling into our world.

However, just think of the characters you will save!

Talk about value!

So! If you feel the need to do the same at times, perhaps
this darker roast is more to your fitting.

### TODO

* write tests
* don't be lazy and copy files
* verbosity command
